# Contributing

Focus: V1 is CLI-first. Please read the ADRs and specs before making larger changes.

## Workflow
- Keep PRs small with a clear scope.
- Tests must pass.
- Do not add new dependencies without a clear justification.

## Important Files
- `docs/adr/000-project-foundations.md` (decisions)
- `docs/specs/v1-feature-set.md` (V1 scope cut)
- `contracts/` (schemas, source of truth)
